# CacheDFLPublic

A **cache-based Distributed Federated Learning** framework (experimental). This repository explores new strategies for caching and data loading in distributed or federated learning scenarios. The code is **research-grade** and not yet production-ready.

## Features

- **Federated Learning Trainer**: A customizable trainer for simulating federated learning across multiple nodes.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Implements a caching module to efficiently manage repeated data access.
- **Data Handling Utilities**: Convenient data loaders for local or remote datasets.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily modify or extend the core classes to fit your own research.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shawnxiaoyuwang/CacheDFLPublic.git
